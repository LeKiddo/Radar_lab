% DESCRIPTION:
% Performs fft on raw I and Q radar data to compute the velocity of a target. 

% Processing is done for every frame which have a spectrum amplitude value higher than infineon's threshold are processed again
% i.e the frames for which eitherÂ a target is approaching or departing
%(all the other frames are not processed by infineon so no comparison is possible)
