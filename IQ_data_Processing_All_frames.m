% DESCRIPTION:
% Performs fft on raw I and Q radar data to compute the velocity and direction of travel of a target. 

% Processing is done for every frame which has a spectrum peak amplitude value higher than infineon's threshold.
% i.e only frames for which eitherÂ a target is approaching or departing are processed. 
% This is done to make comparisons with Infineon's results easier as -
% Infineon's code doesn't send processing info for frames with signal energy below threshold.

    %% Prerequisites for FFT processing 

    % 1- Chebychev window
    % a Chebyshev window is applied to attenuate the sidelobs and make sure that the data is limited.
    
    window = chebwin(num_of_samples,60); % Chebychev window with 60 dB relative sidelobe attenuation instead of 100db default attenuation


    % 2- removal of the signal's DC component before windowing 

    %Computation of mean values for the removal of the signal's DC component 
    I_mean=mean(I);
    Q_mean=mean(Q);
    S_mean=mean(signal);

    % removal of the signal's DC component and windowing
